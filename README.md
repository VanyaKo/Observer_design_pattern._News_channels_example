The problem description is provided by Innopolis University.
Suppose we have the following task: "A news agency can notify channels when it receives news. Receiving news is what
changes the state of the news agency, and it causes the channels to be notified." 
This example is one of the most suitable to implement the Observer pattern. So, observer (subscriber) is a channel which receives news, observable (who notifies 
subscribers) is a news agency.
